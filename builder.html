        <h3>What happened?</h3>
        <p>
            On July 11, 2023, we had received a notice
            from Googleâ„¢, informing us to take down both
            the downloads for the SH1MMER bins and the
            website builder.
            <br>
            This doesn't mark the end of things, but we
            are legally obgliated to take down Wax4Web
            and the downloads for the SH1MMER bins.
            <br>
