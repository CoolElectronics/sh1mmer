        <h3>What happened?</h3>
        <p>
            On July 11, 2023, we had received a notice
            from Google informing us to take down both
            the downloads for the SH1MMER bins and the
            builder, Wax4Web.

            This doesn't mark the end of things, but we
            are legally obgliated to take down Wax4Web
            and the downloads for the SH1MMER bins.
